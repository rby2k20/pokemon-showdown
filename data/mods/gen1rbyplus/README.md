Gen 1, the beginning
====================

Introduction
------------
RBYPlus is a decade-old Pokemon Online mod made by the RBY 2k10 Community. Since PO's decline and the closure of RBY 2k10, the mod kind of faded into obscurity and rarely sees use. However, it did find new life on Pokemon Perfect's PS Server before it shut down. Thanks to Enigami preserving the files, I was able to restore them into something that can be used on 2k20's.
