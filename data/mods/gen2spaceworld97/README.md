Spaceworld 1997
====================

Introduction
------------
Spaceworld 1997 was an event run by Nintendo where Pokemon Gold and Silver were first shown to the public. The demo's massive differences to the final game has earned it extreme noteriety over the years. In 2018, Zammis "Wack0" Clarke leaked many files from Nintendo's iQue servers, including the ROM of this demo. This PS mod replicates the mechanics from this mod to allow it to be played on there.
