RBY 251 [Currently in an Alpha State]
====================

Introduction
------------
This is a port of a Pokemon Online Mod from 2013 that aimed to bring Gen 2 Pokemon to RBY. The mod was originally developed by Crystal_ and was enjoyed in several communities, including Mount Silver, RBY 2k10, Pokemon Perfect and obviously Pokemon Online. This would introduce the Steel and Dark types to a Gen 1 environment, as well as a few exclusive moves (eg. Heracross + Megahorn). The Special stats were either taken from one of the Gen 2 Special Stats or averaged out. Unlike the PO Mod, for now at least, I've kept NFE Pokemon.

General info on the original mod can be found here; http://pokemon-online.eu/threads/18311/

Move Selection, etc
-------------------
Moves are essentially the Gen 2 level-up learnsets with a specific group of TMs and HMs applied, the latter of which can be found here;

Unfortunately there is no conclusive documentation on the exact learnsets, and since PS's teambuilder doesn't support mods too well, you'll need Bulbapedia on hand for the level-up movepools. 

To quote Crystal_ themselves on the selection process;
The level up learnset of GSC Pokemon in RBY 251 matches their level up learnset in GSC excluding the moves that did not exist in RBY.

Signature moves of GSC Pokemon have been kept. This includes Aeroblast (Lugia), Sacred Fire (Ho-oh), Megahorn (Heracross), Sketch (Smeargle), Triple Kick (Hitmontop), Milk Drink (Miltank), Present (Delibird), and Spider Web (Ariados).

Bite is a Dark-type move and Magneton is a Electric/Steel-type Pokemon.

The TM/HM moves available in RBY 251 are only the TM/HM moves available in RBY. These 55 TM/HM moves (50 TM + 5 HM), they can be separated in different groups depending on their status in the following generaion(s):
(If a move satisfies two or more of the following critera, whichever criterion comes first takes precedence)

- Moves learned by every Pokemon in RBY, with the exceptions being only Caterpie, Metapod, Weedle, Kakuna, and Magikarp --> Every GSC Pokemon except Unown and Wobbuffet (and Smeargle who learns everything via Sketch aka level) learns them in RBY 251. Examples: Mimic, Rest.
- Moves that are also TM/HM moves in GSC --> If a Pokemon learns it in GSC, the Pokemon learns it in RBY 251. Otherwise, doesn't. Examples: Fire Blast, Fly.
- Moves that can be learned by tutor in GSC --> If a Pokemon learns it in GSC, the Pokemon learns it in RBY 251. Otherwise, doesn't. Examples: Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Flamethrower.
- Moves that can be learned by TM/tutor in ADV --> If a Pokemon learns it in ADV, the Pokemon learns it in RBY 251. Otherwise, doesn't. Examples: Counter, Body Slam, Swords Dance.
- If a Pokemon can learn a move via breeding but can not learn it via TM/tutor, it does not learn it in RBY 251. Example: Mantine and Rock Slide.

There is a very small number of justified exceptions to these rules. Examples: Hitmontop and Rock Slide (Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee don't learn it in RBY), Espeon/Umbreon and Cut (the other eons don't learn it in RBY). The main exception is Reflect, which has a much wider compatibility in RBY than in ADV, where it is a tutor move.

Reflect and the moves that don't belong to any of the previous criteria have their compatibility chosen according to RBY trends. For example, only Pokemon that can stand in two legs learn Submission; Psychic and Psywave are learned by the same Pokemon, and idem for Water Gun and BubbleBeam. In addition, GSC's Giga Drain and Skull Bash are used as a reference for Mega Drain and Headbutt respectively, because of the very similar spread in GSC (when looking at RBY Pokemon).

The Special stat of each Pokemon is either its GSC Special Attack stat or its GSC Special Defense stat. One stat or another has been chosen following RBY trends, considering the BST, and/or using common sense. There are a few exceptions of Pokemon with a Special stat that doesn't come from its SpA/SpD, [usually for balancing reasons].
