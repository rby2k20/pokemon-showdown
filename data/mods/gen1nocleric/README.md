RBY with no Cleric Clause [Beta]
====================

Introduction
------------
This is a mod designed to allow players to pre-status their Pokemon in RBY formats that do not use Cleric Clause. Good examples of this are Anything Goes and Hackmons. 

To achieve this, the mod adds 5 new items to PS: PAR, SLP, PSN, BRN and FRZ. They're modified versions of the Berserk Gene which will status your Pokemon as they come in. The only issue thus far has been that Poison and Burn will damage you immediately as you lead off or bring in a Pokemon post-KO. Outside of this, so long as you add the items, they're fine. SLP will not count under Sleep Clause, as it's self-inflicted. Same goes for FRZ, but I doubt any sane person will use that. 

To use the mod, simply import/export a set, and add @ status. For example;
  
  Mewtwo @ brn  
  Ability: none  
  - Amnesia  
  - Psychic  
  - Ice Beam  
  - Recover
  
This will create a Mewtwo that burns itself on switch-in, thereby making it unable to be paralyzed without the status being removed by Haze first. Since the Attack drop doesn't affect Mewtwo in the context of this set, the only penalty is the self-damage every turn. 

Abbrevations for status is as follows.
  - PAR = Paralysis
  - SLP = Sleep
  - PSN = Poison
  - BRN = Burn
  - FRZ = Freeze
